EXT. METRO CITY - NIGHT

The camera soars above the towering skyscrapers of Metropolis, the city's neon lights illuminating the dark night sky. The sound of sirens fills the air as police cars speed by, their lights flashing like strobes.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Detective Jameson, a gruff and experienced officer, sits at his desk, staring at a file in front of him. He looks up as his partner, Detective Rosa, enters the room.

ROSA
Jim, we've got a weird one. Kidnapping, apparently.

JAMESON
(skeptical)
What's the connection to the victim?

ROSA
It's not exactly clear. The victim, a young woman named Sarah, was taken from her home by a group of individuals dressed in black.

JAMESON
(raises an eyebrow)
And what's with the mask?

ROSA
That's the weirdest part. They all wore identical black masks with a silver emblem on the forehead.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

The camera pans across the abandoned warehouse, the sound of gravel crunching beneath footsteps the only sound. Suddenly, a figure emerges from the shadows - a young woman, dressed in a black jumpsuit, with a determined look on her face.

CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

The woman, revealed to be Sarah, is chained to a wall. Suddenly, a figure in a black mask appears before her.

MASKED FIGURE
You're a hard girl to find. But now that we have you...

Sarah struggles against her chains, but they're too strong.

CUT TO:

EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Detectives Jameson and Rosa are briefed on the kidnapping. Rosa looks at Jameson, a hint of concern on her face.

ROSA
Jim, I think this case is bigger than we know. These guys are professional. They wouldn't have taken her from her home without a reason.

JAMESON
(sternly)
We'll find her, Rosa. We just need to follow the trail.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING - NIGHT

The camera pans across the abandoned building, the sound of sirens growing louder in the distance. Suddenly, a figure emerges from the shadows - it's the masked figure, followed by a group of individuals dressed in black.

MASKED FIGURE
It's time to play. The game is on.

CUT TO:

EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Detectives Jameson and Rosa are called back to the station, where they're informed that the investigation has gone cold.

ROSA
What do you mean it's gone cold?

JAMESON
(sighs)
The evidence is either tampered with or destroyed. We have nothing.

ROSA
(frustrated)
Then what's going on?

JAMESON
(serious)
We're back to square one. And we need to start from the beginning.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

The camera pans back to the abandoned warehouse, where the masked figure and his group are waiting. Suddenly, a figure emerges from the shadows - it's Sarah, free from her chains.

Sarah approaches the masked figure, who raises his mask, revealing a man with a twisted grin on his face.

MAN
Welcome to the game, Sarah. You're just a pawn. But don't worry, we'll make sure you have a blast.

Sarah looks at him, a mixture of fear and defiance in her eyes.

SARAH
You're not going to get away with this.

MAN
(laughs)
Oh, but we already have.
CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Sarah, still defiant, is dragged deeper into the warehouse by the masked figure and his team. They enter a dimly lit room filled with rows of computer screens and various machinery.

MASCOTED FIGURE
(excitedly)
Welcome to the main event, Sarah! We've been waiting for you.

SARAH
(fearfully)
What do you want from me?

MASKED FIGURE
(smirking)
Oh, you're going to find out. But first, let me introduce you to the game.

The masked figure steps aside, revealing a large screen at the far end of the room. It flickers to life, displaying a countdown timer.

MASKED FIGURE
(explaining)
This is the Omicron Protocol. A game of survival. You see, Sarah, you're not just a pawn. You're a player.

SARAH
(confused)
What do you mean?

MASKED FIGURE
(coldly)
You're going to fight for your life. Opponents will be sent to eliminate you. And the last one standing wins.

The countdown timer reaches zero, and the room erupts in chaos. Suddenly, the lights flicker, and the warehouse is plunged into darkness.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Detectives Jameson and Rosa arrive at the warehouse, responding to a 911 call. They cautiously enter the building, firearms drawn.

JAMESON
(whispering)
Rosa, I think we're too late.

ROSA
(serious)
What do you mean?

JAMESON
(shining his flashlight)
Look at the screens. It's some kind of game show.

ROSA
(stunned)
This is insane.

JAMESON
(determined)
We need to find Sarah before it's too late.

CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

In the darkened room, Sarah struggles to free herself from her restraints. She hears the sound of footsteps, rapidly approaching.

SARAH
(whispering)
Hello? Is someone there?

Suddenly, a figure emerges from the darkness - a woman in a black jumpsuit, with a ninja-like mask covering her face.

NINJA LIKE MASK
(whispering)
You're going to need help if you want to survive.

Sarah's eyes widen in shock as the masked figure helps her free herself from her restraints.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Detectives Jameson and Rosa search the warehouse, frantically calling out for Sarah.

JAMESON
(desperate)
Sarah! We're here! We're going to get you out of this!

Just then, a loud explosion rocks the warehouse, sending the detectives stumbling backward.

CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Sarah and the masked figure make their way through the chaos, fighting off opponents and avoiding traps. They finally reach the warehouse's exit, only to find it blocked by the masked figure's team.

MASKED FIGURE
(smirking)
You're getting close, Sarah. But you won't make it out alive.

SARAH
(defiantly)
We'll see about that.

As the fight escalates, the masked figure reveals his true intentions: to sacrifice Sarah as part of the Omicron Protocol, and to gain control over the city.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Detectives Jameson and Rosa, regrouping outside the warehouse, hear the final confrontation between Sarah and the masked figure.

ROSA
(determined)
Jim, we have to get in there. Now.

JAMESON
(resolute)
Let's go in.

The detectives rush back into the warehouse, guns blazing, to rescue Sarah and take down the masked figure's operation.

FADE TO BLACK.
**EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT**

Detectives Jameson and Rosa burst back into the warehouse, guns drawn. They immediately spot Sarah, fighting off the masked figure's team.

JAMESON
(yelling)
Sarah! Hang on, we're coming!

ROSA
(firearm raised)
Let's take out these scum!

The detectives charge forward, firing their guns. The masked figure's team falls, and Sarah takes advantage of the distraction to strike back. She lands a series of swift kicks, taking down two opponents.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT**

The battle rages on, with the detectives and Sarah working together to take down the masked figure's crew. Jameson takes down a group of thugs, while Rosa protects Sarah from a close attack.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT**

Just as the detectives gain the upper hand, the masked figure appears, his team defeated. He pulls out a device from his pocket and activates it, unleashing a wave of energy that knocks Jameson and Rosa off their feet.

JAMESON
(struggling to get up)
No...it can't be...

ROSA
(also struggling)
What is this thing?!

**CUT TO:**

**INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT**

Sarah, still on her feet, charges at the masked figure. He raises his device, preparing to deliver the final blow.

SARAH
(screaming)
You're going down!

The masked figure hesitates, momentarily stunned. Sarah seizes the opportunity, delivering a devastating kick that sends the device flying out of his hand.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT**

Jameson and Rosa, now back on their feet, charge towards the device. They quickly disable it, and the energy wave dissipates.

JAMESON
(exhaling)
That's it. It's over.

ROSA
(kicking the device away)
We've got him.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT**

Sarah, victorious, approaches the masked figure. The detectives cuff him, as the woman in the black jumpsuit steps forward.

JUMPSUITED WOMAN
(to the detectives)
You shouldn't have come here. He's too powerful.

JAMESON
(firmly)
Not while we're around. You're coming with us.

The detectives haul away the masked figure and the woman, as the warehouse erupts in a chaos of sirens and flashing lights. Sarah, finally free, looks around, stunned by the destruction.

FADE TO BLACK.
**EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT**

Detectives Jameson and Rosa, escorted by uniformed officers, bring the masked figure and the woman in the black jumpsuit to the police station.

JAMESON
(to the officers)
Locker 12, please.

The officers lead the suspects away, as Jameson and Rosa remain behind.

ROSA
(examining the scene)
Jim, what just happened?

JAMESON
(disbelieving)
A high-tech kidnapping, a pseudo-gameshow, and a mysterious woman in a black jumpsuit? This is beyond anything I've seen before.

ROSA
(skeptical)
And what about the Omicron Protocol?

JAMESON
(puzzled)
I don't know, but I intend to find out. Let's get the lab on it and see if we can uncover some answers.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. POLICE LAB - NIGHT**

Detectives Jameson and Rosa review the evidence, trying to make sense of the chaos.

LAB TECHNICIAN
(entering the room)
Detectives, we've finished analyzing the device. It's some sort of advanced technology, but we're still trying to figure out what it does.

JAMESON
(curious)
Any idea who might have created it?

LAB TECHNICIAN
(shrugging)
Not yet, but we're working on it.

ROSA
(examining a piece of evidence)
What about this? Any fingerprints or DNA?

LAB TECHNICIAN
(consulting a screen)
Actually, yes. We found a partial fingerprint on the device. It belongs to a man named Ethan Warner.

JAMESON
(serious)
I know him. He's a brilliant tech expert. But what's his connection to this?

ROSA
(thoughtfully)
Maybe we should pay him a visit.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. E THAN WARNER'S HOME - NIGHT**

Detectives Jameson and Rosa arrive at Ethan Warner's residence, a high-tech mansion on the outskirts of Metropolis.

JAMESON
(through a loudspeaker)
Ethan Warner, we need to ask you some questions.

After a moment, the doors slide open, and Ethan Warner emerges, dressed in a crisp suit.

ETHAN WARNER
(smirking)
What is this, some kind of joke?

JAMESON
(firmly)
Ethan, we know you're involved in the Omicron Protocol. We have evidence.

ETHAN WARNER
(laughing)
Oh, you mean that little experiment? It was all just a test, detectives. A test of humanity's strength and resilience.

ROSA
(skeptical)
A test? You call kidnaping and brainwashing people a test?

ETHAN WARNER
(shrugging)
Whatever you want to call it. The point is, it worked. And now, the real game begins.

JAMESON
(determined)
We're not going to let you do this, Ethan. We'll take you down.

ETHAN WARNER
(smirking)
I'm afraid it's too late for that. The game has already begun. And you're just pawns.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. METROPOLIS - NIGHT**

As the detectives leave Ethan Warner's mansion, they notice a strange glow emanating from the city's skyline. Suddenly, screens around the city flicker to life, displaying a countdown timer.

ROSA
(alarmed)
What's happening?

JAMESON
(grimly)
I think we're in the middle of the Omicron Protocol.

The camera pans out as the city erupts in chaos, the detectives racing against time to uncover the truth behind the sinister plan.

FADE TO BLACK.
**CUT TO:**

**INT. POLICE STATION - DAY**

Detective Jameson and Detective Rosa are interrogating the masked figure, who is still refusing to cooperate.

JAMESON
(firmly)
Look, we don't care about your games or your protocols. We care about the people of Metropolis. And you're going to tell us what's going on.

MASKED FIGURE
(smirking)
You're too late for that. The game is over. And I'm the winner.

ROSA
(angrily)
You're not even going to try to deny it, are you?

MASKED FIGURE
(shrugging)
Why bother? You're just going to keep asking the same stupid questions and I'll keep lying. It's a waste of time.

JAMESON
(leaning in)
You're not going to get away with this. We know who you are. You're Ethan Warner, and you're going to pay for what you've done.

MASKED FIGURE
(laughing)
Ethan Warner? Ha! You have no idea what I am. I'm the one who's been pulling the strings. And you're just pawns in my game.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY**

Sarah is being debriefed by Jameson and Rosa at the abandoned warehouse where the Omicron Protocol took place.

SARAH
(traumatized)
I don't know how I survived...I was so scared...

JAMESON
(kindly)
You did great, Sarah. You're an inspiration. But we need to know what happened. Can you tell us more about the game?

SARAH
(shuddering)
It was like...I was a pawn. They treated me like an animal. Played games with me like I was nothing.

ROSA
(angrily)
We're going to make sure they pay for what they did to you.

SARAH
(pleading)
Please...you have to stop him. He's going to keep doing this. He has to be stopped.

JAMESON
(serious)
We will, Sarah. We promise. And we're going to make sure he never hurts anyone again.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. POLICE STATION - DAY**

Ethan Warner is being taken away in handcuffs as Jameson and Rosa look on.

JAMESON
(to Ethan)
You may have won the game, but the game is over. And you're going to pay the price.

ETHAN WARNER
(smiling)
You'll never be able to stop me. I have the power of the Omicron Protocol.

ROSA
(rolling her eyes)
Oh please, Ethan. You're just a crazed genius trying to play God.

ETHAN WARNER
(laughing)
You don't understand. The Omicron Protocol is just the beginning. And you're just too late to stop me.

**FADE TO BLACK.**
**INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT**

The detectives rush into the warehouse, guns blazing, to rescue Sarah and take down the masked figure's operation.

JAMESON
(yelling)
Police! Drop your weapons!

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT**

Outside, Sarah and the masked figure, still struggling to escape, hear the commotion.

SARAH
(urgently)
We need to get out of here!

MASKED FIGURE
(demurely)
Not yet, Sarah. There's still a game to be played.

Sarah tries to resist, but the masked figure pins her down, mere feet from the entrance of the warehouse.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT**

Detectives Jameson and Rosa, moving swiftly, try to reach Sarah and put an end to the Omicron Protocol.

(taking cover behind a nearby pillar)
I see her. But I can't get a clear shot.

JAMESON
(determined)
We need to move in. Now.

The detectives make a break for the exposed corner of the warehouse where Sarah is being held captive.

CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

The detectives are caught off guard by the blast, stumbling backward as they try to regain their footing.

JAMESON
(yelling over the chaos)
Rosa, get Sarah!

ROSA
(shouting back)
I'm trying!

The masked figure, taking advantage of the disarray, attempts to make a run for it with Sarah still in tow.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT**

As the masked figure and his accomplices attempt to escape, the detectives give chase, dodging falling debris and debris-laden crates.

JAMESON
(panting)
We have to catch them!

(grimly)
And put an end to this once and for all.

The chase culminates in a small alleyway nearby, where the detectives finally corner the masked figure.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT**

ROSA
(nodding)
We're taking you in for questioning.

As the police lead Sarah away, the masked figure, still defiant, looks on, his eyes burning with anger.

Masked Figure
(menacingly)
This...this isn't the end. The Omicron Protocol will rise again. And no one will stop me.

JAMESON
(frustrated)
We're getting nowhere. We need a break in this case.

ROSA
(skeptical)
I don't know, Jim. This case is like nothing I've ever seen before. Ethan Warner is a genius, and we're just a couple of cops trying to catch up.

JAMESON
( determination in his voice)
That's exactly why we need to catch up. We can't let him get away with this. He's playing with people's lives.

ROSA
(serious)
And what about Sarah? She's the only one who's been able to give us a lead. We need to make sure she's safe.

(nodding)
I've got an idea. Let's get her to safety and then we can start building a case against Ethan Warner.

I think I've got it. I think I know how we can catch Ethan Warner.

ROSA
( intrigued)
What is it?

JAMESON
(proudly)
I've been going over the evidence, and I think I've found a pattern. Ethan Warner is using the same technique over and over again. He's using the Omicron Protocol to control people's minds.

ROSA
(impressed)
That's genius, Jim. How did you figure it out?

JAMESON
(humbly)
Just good old-fashioned police work. And a lot of luck.

Detective Jameson and Detective Rosa are facing off against Ethan Warner, who is controlling a group of mindless drones.

JAMESON
(firmly)

You're too late. The Omicron Protocol is already in place. And soon, I'll be the ruler of this city.

ROSA

You're not going to get away with this.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. ETHERNAL CITY - DAY**

Detective Jameson and Detective Rosa are standing outside the city, looking at the destruction Ethan Warner has caused.

This is what we've been fighting against. The destruction of our city, our people.

JAMESON

You're right, Rosa. We will rebuild this city, and we will make sure that Ethan Warner never harms anyone again.

ROSA
(smiling)
Let's do it.

**FADE TO BLACK.**
I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided context is not a movie script, but rather a series of fragments and scenes. To create a continuation, I'll need to understand the story and its characters better. Could you please provide more context or clarify the plot?

ETHAN WARNER
(smirking)
You'll never stop it. It's already too late.

ROSA
(firmly)
We're not going to give up, Ethan. We'll stop you one way or another.

JAMESON
(serious)
We need to know what's happening, Ethan. We need to know why you're doing this.

ETHAN WARNER
(shrugging)
Because I can. Because I'm powerful enough to change the world.

ROSA
(determined)
We'll stop you, Ethan. And we'll make sure you pay for what you've done.

ETHAN WARNER
(laughing)
You're just pawns in a much larger game, detectives. And you'll never win.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. METROPOLIS - DAY**

The city is in chaos as the Omicron Protocol's effects become more apparent. Buildings are crumbling, and people are running for their lives.

What's happening? This can't be real!

JAMESON
(serious)
We need to find a way to stop it, Sarah. We need to find a way to reverse the effects of the Omicron Protocol.

ROSA
(thoughtfully)
I think I might have an idea, Jim. I think I remember something about a device that can counteract the protocol's effects.

JAMESON
(optimistic)
That's our best shot, Rosa. Let's go find it.

**CUT TO:**

I've got an idea. I can take out a few of them.

The masked figure nods, and Sarah takes down several guards. The group makes a break for the exit, but it's blocked by Ethan Warner.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY**

Ethan Warner reveals his true intentions, trying to convince the group that the Omicron Protocol is the future.

ETHAN WARNER
(persistently)
You're just a few old-fashioned romantics, stuck in the past. The Omicron Protocol is the future. It's the key to a better world.

ROSA
(disgusted)
You're a monster, Ethan. And you'll never win.

JAMESON

We'll stop you, Ethan. And we'll make sure you pay for what you've done.

Ethan Warner laughs, and the group charges forward.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. POLICE STATION - DAY**

Detectives Jameson and Rosa are reviewing the evidence and trying to make sense of the chaos.

JAMESON
(to Rosa)
We need to get to the bottom of this. We can't let Ethan Warner get away with this.

ROSA
(skeptical)
But how are we going to stop him? He's got a whole army of drones at his disposal.

JAMESON
(determined)
We'll figure it out. We always do.

Suddenly, the loudspeaker beeps.

LAB TECHNICIAN
(over the loudspeaker)
Detectives, we've made a breakthrough. We've hacked into the mainframe of the Omicron Protocol and we're getting access to all the information we need.

ROSA
(excitedly)
That's great news! We can finally start to stop Ethan Warner's plan.

JAMESON
(authoritatively)
Assemble a team and we'll move in on Ethan Warner's location.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. ETHERNAL CITY - DAY**

The team, including Detectives Jameson and Rosa, arrive at the location of the Omicron Protocol's headquarters.

JAMESON
(to the team)
Alright, let's move in. We need to take out Ethan Warner and his drones.

ROSA
(to the team)
Remember, we don't know what kind of technology we're up against. We need to be careful.

The team moves in, taking down drone after drone. They finally reach the entrance of the headquarters.

JAMESON
(to the team)
Alright, let's split up. Rosa, you take the left flank. I'll take the right. We'll meet at the center.

ROSA
(nodding)
Roger that.

The team moves in, taking out Ethan Warner's minions and finally reaching the heart of the headquarters.

JAMESON
(to Ethan Warner)
It's over, Warner. You're not going to get away with this.

ETHAN WARNER
(laughing)
You're too late. The Omicron Protocol is already in place. And soon, I'll be the ruler of this city.

ROSA
(angrily)
You're a monster, Warner. And you're going to pay for what you've done.

JAMESON
(drawing his gun)
It's time to stop you, Warner.

The camera cuts to black as Ethan Warner makes a last-ditch effort to escape.

**FADE IN:**

**EXT. ETHERNAL CITY - DAY**

The camera cuts to a shot of the city, as the Omicron Protocol's effects start to take hold.

Detectives Jameson and Rosa are frantically working to understand the situation.

JAMESON
(to Rosa)
We need to get to the source of this. Find out who's behind it.

ROSA
(type on computer)
I'm trying, but every lead is dead-ending.

JAMESON
(frustrated)
We need to find Ethan Warner. He's the only one who knows what's going on.

ROSA
( suddenly excited)
I think I found something, Jim.

JAMESON
(excited)
What is it?

ROSA
(reading from screen)
A hidden server, encrypted with Ethan Warner's fingerprints. It's a real lead this time.

JAMESON
(determined)
Let's go.

**CUT TO:**

**INT. ETHERNAL CITY - NIGHT**

Detectives Jameson and Rosa infiltrate Eternal City, a skyscraper complex owned by Ethan Warner.

Stay close, Jim. We don't know what we're walking into.

Let's move. We can't waste any more time.

They make their way to the top floor, where they find Ethan Warner awaiting them.

ETHAN WARNER
(smirking)
Ah, Detectives. I've been expecting you. You're just in time to see the final act of the Omicron Protocol.

JAMESON
(angrily)
You're behind this, Warner. You're the one who's been controlling people's minds.

ETHAN WARNER
(laughing)
Oh, no. I'm just the conductor. The real mastermind remains anonymous.

ROSA
(suspicious)
What do you mean?

ETHAN WARNER
( pointing to a screen)
Look. The countdown has begun. In five minutes, the Omicron Protocol will be complete.

JAMESON
(determined)
We can't let that happen. We have to stop it.

ETHAN WARNER
(shrugging)
You're just pawns. The game is already won.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. METROPOLIS - NIGHT**

The countdown reaches its final minutes. The city is in chaos, with people running wildly and police struggling to maintain order.

ROSA
(to Jameson)
Jim, I think I figure out what the Omicron Protocol does.

JAMESON
(curious)
What is it?

ROSA
(urgently)
It's creating a mind-link between every person in the city. We're talking about a global network of thought.

JAMESON
(stunned)
That's...that's impossible.

ROSA
(serious)
And it's happening. Right now.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT**

Detectives Jameson and Rosa, still trying to stop the Omicron Protocol, receive a call from an unknown number.

ROSA
(anxiously)
Jim, it's a call from Ethan Warner.

JAMESON
(determined)
Answer it. Find out what he's saying.

ROSA
(picking up phone)
Hello?

ETHAN WARNER
(over phone)
Detectives, I have a message for you. You will never stop the Omicron Protocol. And once it's complete, you'll be absorbed into the mind-link.

ROSA
(angrily)
You're crazy, Warner. You're playing God.

ETHAN WARNER
(laughing)
I'm not playing God. I'm creating a new reality. And you're just two insignificant pieces in the game.

**CUT TO:**

**EXT. METROPOLIS - NIGHT**

The countdown reaches zero. The city erupts in a brilliant flash of light, as people around the world suddenly feel an intense connection to one another.

ROSA
(awed)
Jim, it's happening. The Omicron Protocol is complete.

JAMESON
(stunned)
We're too late.

ROSA
(urgently)
We have to get out of here, Jim. Before we're consumed by the mind-link.

JAMESON
(determined)
We're not giving up. We'll find a way to stop this.

ROSA
(decisively)
Then let's move, Jim. We have to save humanity.

JAMESON
(proudly)
You're right, Rosa. We will rebuild this city, and we will make sure that Ethan Warner never harms anyone again.

ROSA
(smiling)
We'll start by stopping him.

JAMESON
(firmly)
We'll get him, Rosa. We'll make sure he pays for what he's done.

(serious)
And what about Sarah? She's still caught up in the Omicron Protocol. We need to get her out.

(curiously)
What is it?

JAMESON
(proudly)
I've been analyzing the device, and I think I've found a way to hack into it and shut down the protocol.

ROSA
(impressed)
That's genius, Jim. How did you figure it out?

JAMESON
(humbly)
Just good old-fashioned police work. And a lot of luck.

Well, whatever it was, it worked. Now let's go put an end to this.
