We need a break in this case.\n\nROSA\n(skeptical)\nI don't know, Jim. This case is like nothing I've ever seen before. Ethan Warner is a genius, and we're just a couple of cops trying to catch up.\n\nJAMESON\n( determination in his voice)\nThat's exactly why we need to catch up. We can't let him get away with this. He's playing with people's lives.\n\nROSA\n(serious)\nAnd what about Sarah? She's the only one who's been able to give us a lead. We need to make sure she's safe.\n\nJAMESON\n(nodding)\nI've got an idea.

Ethan Warner is using the same technique over and over again. He's using the Omicron Protocol to control people's minds.\n\nROSA\n(impressed)\nThat's genius, Jim. How did you figure it out?\n\nJAMESON\n(humbly)\nJust good old-fashioned police work. And a lot of luck.\n\nROSA\n(smiling)\nWell, whatever it was, it worked. Now let's go catch Ethan Warner.\n\n**CUT TO:**\n\n**EXT.

We've got the evidence, and we've got each other. We can take down Ethan Warner.\n\nROSA\n(nodding)\nLet's do it.\n\n**CUT TO:**\n\n**INT. ETHERNAL CITY - DAY**\n\nDetective Jameson and Detective Rosa are sneaking through the city, trying to avoid detection.\n\nJAMESON\n(whispering)\nStay close.

We'll stop you one way or another.\n\nJAMESON\n(serious)\nWe need to know what's happening, Ethan. We need to know why you're doing this.\n\nETHAN WARNER\n(shrugging)\nBecause I can. Because I'm powerful enough to change the world.\n\nROSA\n(determined)\nWe'll stop you, Ethan.
